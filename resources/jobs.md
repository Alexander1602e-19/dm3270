### Batch jobs
Use CMD-J to show the following window.  
![Jobs](jobs1.png?raw=true "jobs")
As jobs are submitted and then complete the information shown in this window will be updated.  
![Jobs](jobs2.png?raw=true "jobs")
After a job completes, its output can be copied from the JES queue to your own dataset (this also deletes the files from JES). After the output has been copied, it can be transferred in the same way as any other file.
