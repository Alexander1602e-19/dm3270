### Batch jobs
Use CMD-J to show the following window. It will keep track of any jobs that are submitted during the current session.  
![Jobs](jobs1.png?raw=true "jobs")  
As jobs finish the information shown in this window will be updated. Completed jobs can have their output copied from the JES queue to your own dataset (this also deletes the files from JES). After the output has been copied, it can be transferred in the same way as any other file.  
![Jobs](jobs2.png?raw=true "jobs")  
The output is available from the Report window (CMD-R).  
![Output](output1.png?raw=true "output")
