### Batch jobs
Use CMD-J to show the Batch Jobs window. It will keep track of any jobs that are submitted during the current session. As jobs finish the information shown here will be updated.  
![Jobs](jobs1.png?raw=true "jobs")  
Completed jobs can have their output copied from the JES queue to your own dataset using the Execute button (this also deletes the files from JES). After the output has been copied, it can be transferred using the same mechanism.  
![Jobs](jobs2.png?raw=true "jobs")  
The output is available from the Report window (CMD-R). Later it will be possible to print reports directly from this window, and also to save a local copy on your PC.
