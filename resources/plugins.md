### Plugins (incomplete)
This facility allows users to write their own plugin java modules which are able to examine and process all 3270 input screens. After each screen is displayed all active plugins are called with a list of the fields on the screen. Modifiable fields may be altered, the cursor may be moved and any of the usual command or function keys may be pressed. Plugins can also be triggered by a command key if desired.
