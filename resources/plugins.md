### Plugins
This function is not complete yet. The intention is to allow users to write their own java plugin modules which will be able to examine and process all 3270 input screens. After each screen is displayed all active plugins will be called with a list of the fields on the screen. Modifiable fields may be altered, the cursor may be moved and any of the usual command or function keys may be pressed.
